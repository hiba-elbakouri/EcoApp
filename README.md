# EcoApp

In this project I created a Dashboard App using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with the integration of machine learning predictions. The frontend is  developed using Vite as the starter application, Redux Toolkit for state management, Material UI for the component library, and Recharts for creating interactive charts. On the backend, I utilize Node.js as the runtime environment, Express.js as the backend framework, and MongoDB as the database.
